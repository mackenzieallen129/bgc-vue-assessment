# BGC Vue Assessment
Mackenzie Allen's submission for the Brain Game Center's Vue proficiency assessment. This project is a responsive Vue single page web application. 

- It contains a to-do list where users can add, edit, or delete new tasks, along with checking off completed tasks. Completed tasks move to a separate list where users can see the date and time each item was completed. 
- It also contains a weather widget bringing back the local weather. Through the use of the API at https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api, users can see the temperature and weather conditions on first glance. When users hover over the widget, additional information (such as humidity and UV index) can be seen.
